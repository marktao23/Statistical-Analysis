# Statistical-Analysis-Work

This is simply a collection of a lot of the statistical analysis I've done over the past year or so.
A lot of it was done in tandem with Sean Westwood and are R markdown files that have been knit to pdf.
Each of the files explains in detail what kind of dataset we're working with, as well as what we're trying
to calculate/conclude with them.
